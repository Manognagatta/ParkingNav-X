**What's missing:**
- [ ] Occupancy prediction model (for each parking lot)
- [ ] Queue length prediction (for each gate)
- [ ] Congestion prediction (for each road)
- [ ] Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.)

**What's needed:**
1. Feature engineering
   - Time-of-day (hour, minute)
   - Day-of-week (weekday vs weekend)
   - Day-of-month / academic calendar
   - Historical lags (t-1, t-2, t-4, t-96)
   - Event indicators (placement, exam, festival)

2. Model selection

   - Medium: Ensemble (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Advanced: LSTM, Transformer for sequence prediction

3. Evaluation
   - Train/test split (chronological 70/30)
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, directional accuracy

```

---

### ❌ STAGE 7: FUTURE RISK (NOT STARTED)

**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**What's missing:**

- [ ] Congestion risk (P(travel time > threshold))
- [ ] Gate bottleneck risk (P(queue > threshold))
- [ ] Wait time estimation

   - Congestion: risk = 1 - e^(-congestion_level)
   - Wait time: E[wait] based on queue model

2. Confidence bounds
   - Use prediction confidence intervals
   - Higher uncertainty → higher risk

3. Event-aware adjustment
   - Higher multiplier during major events
   - Reduced confidence during rare events

4. Integration with current state

- [ ] Constraint enforcement (capacity, availability, gates)
- [ ] Real-time decision latency measurement

**What's needed:**
1. Formulation
   - Decision: which parking lot to recommend?
   - Objective: minimize (distance + congestion + overflow risk)
   - Constraints: available spaces, open gate, reachable

2. Algorithm
   - Option A: Greedy (rank all lots, pick best)
   - Option B: Iterative deepening (try solutions, refine)
   - Option C: Machine learning (learn policy from data)

3. Scoring details
   - Distance: normalized 0-1 (max distance = 1)
   - Congestion: predicted traffic delay
   - Overflow: risk from Stage 7
   - Weights: w_d=0.3, w_c=0.3, w_o=0.4 (tunable)

4. Tie-breaking
   - If multiple lots score same: prefer nearest
   - If still tied: prefer lower congestion
   - Distance-first vs congestion-first variants

5. Robustness
   - Handle all lots full (return None, guide to overflow)
   - Handle all gates closed (return None)
   - Handle prediction errors gracefully
