### Implementation Checklist

#### 6.1 Feature Engineering (1 day)
- [ ] Create `prediction_features.py`
- [ ] Extract temporal features
  - [ ] Hour of day (0-23)
  - [ ] Day of week (0-6)
  - [ ] Is weekend? (bool)
  - [ ] Academic calendar event? (bool)
  - [ ] Major event multiplier (0.05-1.50)

- [ ] Handle missing values (forward fill for early days)
- [ ] Normalize features (0-1 scale)

**Test case:**
```python
from prediction_features import OccupancyFeatureExtractor
extractor = OccupancyFeatureExtractor('data/vitap_occupancy_data_complete_30days.csv')
features = extractor.extract(parking_lot_id='vitap-lot-1', timestamp='2026-09-15 14:30')
assert len(features) > 5  # At least 5 features
assert all(0 <= f <= 1 for f in features.values())
```

#### 6.2 Model Training (1.5 days)
- [ ] Create `prediction.py` with `OccupancyPredictor` class
- [ ] Load historical data from database
- [ ] Train/test split (70% / 30%, chronological)
- [ ] Train Random Forest model
  - [ ] n_estimators=100
  - [ ] max_depth=15
  - [ ] min_samples_split=5
- [ ] Train LSTM model (optional, for better accuracy)
  - [ ] Sequence length = 4 (60 minutes of history)
  - [ ] Hidden units = 64
  - [ ] Dropout = 0.2
- [ ] Store trained model in `database/models/`
- [ ] Evaluate on test set
  - [ ] MAE (mean absolute error)
  - [ ] RMSE (root mean squared error)
  - [ ] MAPE (mean absolute percentage error)
  - [ ] Directional accuracy (did we get trend right?)

**Test case:**
```python
from prediction import OccupancyPredictor
predictor = OccupancyPredictor()
predictor.train('digital_twin.db', parking_lot_id='vitap-lot-1')
predictions = predictor.predict(features_dict)
assert 0 <= predictions['occupancy'] <= 120  # Within capacity
assert 0 <= predictions['confidence'] <= 1
print(f"Predicted: {predictions['occupancy']} ± {predictions['std_dev']}")
```

#### 6.3 Prediction API Integration (0.5 days)
- [ ] Add method to `twin_service.py` to call predictor
- [ ] Implement prediction caching (cache for 5 minutes)
- [ ] Handle prediction failures gracefully (fallback to current occupancy)
- [ ] Store predictions in `prediction_history` table (new)

**Test case:**
```python
from digital_twin.twin_service import TwinService
service = TwinService('digital_twin.db')
pred = service.predict_occupancy('vitap-lot-1')
assert pred is not None
assert 'occupancy' in pred and 'confidence' in pred
```

#### 6.4 Validation & Testing (0.5 days)
- [ ] Create `tests/test_prediction.py`
- [ ] Test: predictions are within capacity bounds
- [ ] Test: confidence decreases with time horizon
- [ ] Test: predictions follow expected patterns (peak in evening, etc.)
- [ ] Test: model accuracy on full test set

---

## STAGE 7: RISK CALCULATION

### Goal
Calculate overflow risk, congestion risk, and wait time risk based on predictions.

### File Structure
```
digital_twin/models/
├── risk.py              ← CREATE (new)
└── risk_models.py       ← CREATE (new)
```

### Implementation Checklist

#### 7.1 Risk Functions (1 day)
- [ ] Create `risk.py` with risk calculators
- [ ] **Overflow Risk** (per parking lot)
  - [ ] P(occupancy > capacity) based on prediction distribution
  - [ ] Formula: `risk = (predicted_occupancy / capacity) ^ 2`
  - [ ] If confidence low: risk += 0.1 * (1 - confidence)
- [ ] **Congestion Risk** (per road)
  - [ ] P(travel_time > threshold)
  - [ ] Formula: `risk = 1 - e^(-congestion_level)`
  - [ ] Scale by vehicle count
- [ ] **Queue Risk** (per gate)
  - [ ] P(queue > threshold)
  - [ ] Formula: `risk = queue_length / gate_capacity`
- [ ] **Wait Time Risk** (combined)
  - [ ] Expected wait = queueing model(queue_length, capacity)

**Test case:**
```python
from risk import OverflowRisk, CongestionRisk
overflow = OverflowRisk()
risk = overflow.calculate(
    predicted_occupancy=95,
    capacity=100,
    confidence=0.85
)
assert 0 <= risk <= 1
assert risk > 0.5  # High risk when near capacity
```

#### 7.2 Risk Integration with Prediction (0.5 days)
- [ ] Link prediction confidence to risk bounds
- [ ] Use confidence intervals (e.g., 68%, 95%)
- [ ] Higher uncertainty → higher risk penalty
- [ ] Handle edge cases (all lots full, prediction unavailable)

#### 7.3 Event-Aware Risk (0.5 days)
- [ ] Check academic calendar for active events
- [ ] Check major events list
- [ ] Apply multipliers to risk
  - [ ] Placement drive: risk ×1.5 (more vehicles)
  - [ ] Exam period: risk ×0.6 (fewer vehicles)
  - [ ] Sports festival: risk ×1.3

#### 7.4 Testing (0.5 days)
- [ ] Create `tests/test_risk.py`
- [ ] Test: risk increases with occupancy
- [ ] Test: risk is zero when empty
- [ ] Test: event multipliers apply correctly
- [ ] Test: all risks in [0, 1] range

---

## STAGE 8: MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION

### Goal
Implement ParkingNav-X strategy that balances distance, congestion, and overflow risk.

### File Structure
```
digital_twin/simulation/
├── demo_strategies.py    ← EXTEND (add ParkingNavXStrategy)
└── scoring.py            ← CREATE (new)
```

### Implementation Checklist

#### 8.1 Scoring Function (1 day)
- [ ] Create `scoring.py` with score calculation
- [ ] **Base Score Formula:**
  ```
  score = distance_score × w_distance
        + congestion_score × w_congestion
        + overflow_score × w_overflow
  
  where:
    w_distance = 0.3
    w_congestion = 0.3
    w_overflow = 0.4
  ```

- [ ] **Distance Score** (normalized 0-1)
  ```python
  max_distance = max distance from gate to any lot
  distance_score = (distance_to_lot / max_distance)
  ```

- [ ] **Congestion Score** (0-1)
  ```python
  congestion_score = congestion_risk_from_stage7
  ```

- [ ] **Overflow Score** (0-1)
  ```python
  overflow_score = overflow_risk_from_stage7
  ```

- [ ] Handle constraints
  - [ ] If lot full: score = infinity (exclude)
  - [ ] If gate closed: cannot use (exclude)
  - [ ] If road blocked: add penalty to distance
  - [ ] If prediction unavailable: use current occupancy

**Test case:**
```python
from scoring import ParkingNavXScorer
scorer = ParkingNavXScorer(w_dist=0.3, w_cong=0.3, w_over=0.4)
score = scorer.score(
    parking_lot_id='vitap-lot-1',
    distance=250,
    congestion_risk=0.3,
    overflow_risk=0.6,
    is_available=True
)
assert 0 <= score <= 2.0  # Valid range
```

#### 8.2 ParkingNavXStrategy Class (1 day)
- [ ] Create `ParkingNavXStrategy` in `demo_strategies.py`
- [ ] Implement `recommend()` method
  - [ ] Get all available parking lots
  - [ ] Get current occupancy & prediction
  - [ ] Calculate risk for each lot
  - [ ] Score each lot
  - [ ] Return lot with lowest score
  - [ ] Return confidence (based on score spread)
- [ ] Implement `evaluate()` for simulation
  - [ ] Track metrics per vehicle
  - [ ] Log scores for analysis

**Test case:**
```python
from demo_strategies import ParkingNavXStrategy
from digital_twin.models import Campus, Vehicle, Gate

campus = Campus.load('vitap')
vehicle = Vehicle(...)
entry_gate = campus.get_gate('vitap-gate-main')

strategy = ParkingNavXStrategy(campus)
recommendation = strategy.recommend(
    vehicle=vehicle,
    entry_gate=entry_gate,
    current_timestamp='2026-09-15 14:30'
)
assert recommendation['parking_lot_id'] in [lot.id for lot in campus.parking_lots]
assert 0 <= recommendation['score'] <= 2.0
```

#### 8.3 Tie-Breaking & Fallbacks (0.5 days)
- [ ] If multiple lots have same score (within ε=0.01)
  - [ ] Prefer nearest lot
  - [ ] Then prefer least congested road
  - [ ] Then prefer lowest overflow risk
- [ ] If all lots full
  - [ ] Return None with guidance to overflow parking
  - [ ] Suggest alternative times
- [ ] If all gates closed
  - [ ] Return None with error message

#### 8.4 Testing (1 day)
- [ ] Create `tests/test_optimization.py`
- [ ] Test: ParkingNavXStrategy scores correctly
- [ ] Test: all 5 scenarios run without error
- [ ] Test: tie-breaking works
- [ ] Test: constraints are enforced
- [ ] Test: handles edge cases (all full, all closed, etc.)
- [ ] Compare vs baselines (First Available, Nearest Available)

### 9.1 End-to-End Integration (1 day)
- [ ] Update simulation engine to use predictions
  ```python
  # In engine.py, at each timestep:
  for lot in campus.parking_lots:
      prediction = predictor.predict(lot.id)
      lot.predicted_occupancy = prediction['occupancy']
      lot.prediction_confidence = prediction['confidence']
  ```

- [ ] Update strategy to use predictions
